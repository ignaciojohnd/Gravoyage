        <h1>Gravoyage</h1>
        <h2>Game Design Document</h2>
        <p>Lena Girdhar, John Turrigiano, John Dominic Ignacio</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>This document outlines the concept and design for a game called “Gravoyage.” 
            This is intended to be a 2D platforming game with some focus on puzzles, 
            using animated sprites, tiled assets, collision detection and an emphasis 
            on gravity manipulation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Technology</b></h3>
        <p>This will be developed with the Wolfie 2D engine and be intended for Windows browsers. </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>Backstory</b></h3>
        <p>Julliet is a space explorer who is trying to get back to her home planet, 
            but her ship doesn’t have enough energy to make it all the way. 
            She has to stop at planets along the way and collect energy crystals that 
            power her ship in order to continue her journey a little at a time. </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>Objective</b></h3>
        <p>Julliet has a special suit that allows her to control her own gravity on each planet, 
            meaning she can change the direction of gravity applying to her. 
            She is able to ignore the natural gravity on each planet and create her own ideal way 
            to traverse the terrain and reach the crystals that she needs.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Gameplay</b></h3>
        <p>The gameplay functions with usual platforming rules, but at any time you can flip the 
            direction of gravity, so you could be standing on a wall or ceiling. Some objects may 
            also be affected by this gravity change, but enemies typically will not be. There are 
            only a certain number of charges that allows you to change gravity per level. If you 
            run out of charges and you have not yet reached the goal, you must restart.</p>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Controls</b></h3>
        <p>This game will be played using a keyboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LEFT-ARROW - Change gravity to left</li>
            <li>RIGHT-ARROW - Change gravity to right</li>
            <li>UP-ARROW - Change gravity to up</li>
            <li>DOWN-ARROW - Change gravity to down</li>
            <li>W - Jump</li>
            <li>A - Walk left relative to gravity</li>
            <li>D - Walk right relative to gravity</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3><b>Graphical User Interface</b></h3>
